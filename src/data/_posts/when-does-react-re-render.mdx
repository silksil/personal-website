As a React developer, it is important to know when a component re-renders, because it can affect UI and impact performance. This guide explains when re-rendering happens and what happens “under the hood”. It will also discuss when it can impact performance and how you should deal with it for optimization.

## What triggers re-rendering?

When React needs to update the app with new data, re-rendering occurs. In most cases, this occurs because users are interacting with the app or because some external data is coming through as an asynchronous request. This causes state changes, which results in re-rendering. So, the first takeaway is that **every re-render in React starts with a state change.**

These state changes that cause a component to re-render can come from different "sources", namely:

1.  **Component:** state changes in a component itself will cause a re-render of that component.
2.  **Context**: all components that use a `Context` will re-render when the value in the `Context` changes, even if they don’t use the changed data directly.
3.  **Hook**: a change in state in the hook, will cause a re-render in the “host” component that uses the hook.
4.  **Parent**: if the parent re-renders, the default behaviour is that **all its children** **also re-render.**

### Do components re-render if props change?

A common misconception is that props changes cause a component to re-render. By itself, this is not the case.

When a component re-renders, it tries to re-render all descendants, regardless of whether they're being passed a particular state variable through props. If a state change happens in a parent it would have to re-render, which will trigger re-render of all the child components regardless of its props.

Only when memoization techniques are being applied (e.g. `React.memo` `useMemo` and `useCallback`) props changes are of influence.

## What happens “under the hood” when React re-renders?

Rendering a component and updating the DOM for that component are two separate steps in the lifecycle. After React re-renders, it updates the **virtual DOM** tree, which is only a virtual representation of the DOM that performs better than the real DOM.

Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React compares the current version of the virtual DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM. This process is called **“diffing”**. When React identified which virtual DOM objects have changed, it will continue updating only those objects in the real DOM. This makes the performance far better when compared to manipulating the real DOM directly. This whole process of comparing the virtual DOM and updating the ‘real’ DOM is referred to by React as **reconciliation**.

> _The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation._ – **React Documentation**

## Is re-rendering bad for performance?

**Re-rendering components is often not a bad thing; components are often small and cheap**. In many cases, using React will lead to a fast UI without putting a lot of effort into optimising for performance. However, if re-renders happen too frequently or on heavy components, this may result in a sluggish user experience, visible delays on every action, or the app becoming completely inoperable.

## How to deal with re-rendering?

As mentioned, you often don’t have to focus on optimization, as React is highly optimised and re-renders often don't affect performance. Nonetheless, there are a couple of scenarios in which I do pay extra attention to re-rendering:

- **Context**: There might be dozens of components that consume a specific Context. All of these components would be forced to re-render if the values in the parent change, and thus it is more likely to affect performance.
- **Hooks**: If I create a custom reusable hook, the hook may be reused over lots of places in the app, and therefore it is more likely that it can impact performance.
- **Lists**: If I have to display long lists, I pay extra attention to optimization, as one state change may cause many components to re-render.

If you eventually decide to optimise in order to deal with re-rendering, they are different strategies that you can apply, for example:

- Use composition: encapsulate state changes in a smaller component to make sure that state changes only affect this component and not other portions of the render tree.
- Use `useMemo` or `useCallback` to avoid expensive calculations on every re-render.
- Use `memo` to explicitly tell a component not to re-render if the props do not change.

In a seperate article, I will dive deeper into these strategies.

## Summary

- A component re-renders due to state changes. State changes that cause a component to re-render can come from different places: state changes in the component, parent re-renders, context changes, and hooks changes.
- React makes use of a lightweight copy of the actual DOM — aka virtual DOM — to track which parts have changed, to eventually only update those objects in the real DOM.
- Re-rendering components is often not a bad thing; components are often small and cheap.
- If re-renders happen too frequently or on heavy components, you can apply different strategies to deal with this, including `memo`, `useMemo` , `useCallback` and composition.
